## Purpose of the Project

- Build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using HTML and CSS as main technologies
- Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
- Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub

#

## Features
